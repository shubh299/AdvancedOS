# Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System
There are trackers and clients in this system. Trackers have the information about clients and and files that each client has. The clients are assumed to be in same network. For both trackers and clients, we input the network port number that they will be using.

The clients register with the tracker, a username and a password. The client then registers the availability of a file with the tracker. Another client that wants to download a file, also registers with tracker using a username and a password. The asking client requests the list of peers that have the requested file. On receiving the list, the client checks which of the peers are available and have the file. The file is broken into chunks of size 512 KB each. The chunks are downloaded in round-robin manner from the peers parallelly. On completeion, the client updates the tracker that it also has the file. The more the number of peers that have the file, the faster will be downloading.
